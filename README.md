# MuseScore 3.3+ plugin - BulkVelocityChange

Small MuseScore 3.3+ plugin to change velocities of notes in bulk. Useful for when notes have different velocities and it's inconvenient to add 10 (for example) to each note individually in the inspector. Sounds niche and it probably is, but I've wanted this for so long that I finally decided to make it myself.

Install by simply downloading the code from here and copying the .qml file into the MuseScore plugins folder (C:\Program Files\MuseScore [version]\plugins on Windows).

Thanks to [Articulation and Ornamentation Control](https://github.com/BernardGreenberg/MuseScorePlugins) for both a great QoL tool and a helpful code reference (eww, JavaScript).
